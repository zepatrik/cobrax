# Cobrax - Helpers for [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

This project provides helpers for the commonly used [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library.
It specifically aims to make commands composable and reusable, as well as to make testing easier.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/zepatrik/cobrax
```

## Usage

Extensive documentation is available on https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zepatrik/cobrax.

## About

This project is based on all the small tweaks and helpers I have accumulated over the years of using cobra while working
on [Ory projects](https://github.com/ory). This library might be transferred to the Ory organization in the future.
